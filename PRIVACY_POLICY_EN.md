## Introduction

OneBookmark ("the Extension") is a browser extension that syncs your bookmarks to GitHub Gist. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data We Access

| Data Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Browser Bookmarks** | Read and sync to GitHub Gist |
| **GitHub Personal Access Token** | Authenticate with GitHub API |
| **Gist ID** | Identify your backup location |

## How We Use Your Data

- **Bookmark Sync**: Your bookmarks are uploaded to your own GitHub Gist only when you initiate a sync.
- **Local Storage**: Settings (Token, Gist ID) are stored locally in your browser's extension storage.
- **No Server**: We do not operate any backend server. Data flows directly between your browser and GitHub.

## Data Sharing

- **We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your data to any third party.**
- Your bookmarks are stored only in your personal GitHub Gist account.
- We have no access to your GitHub Token or bookmark data.

## Data Security

- Your GitHub Token is stored locally in your browser's secure extension storage.
- All communication with GitHub API uses HTTPS encryption.
- We recommend using a token with minimal permissions (`gist` scope only).

## Your Rights

You can:
- **View** all stored data in your browser's extension settings
- **Delete** all extension data by uninstalling the extension
- **Revoke** GitHub Token access at any time from GitHub Settings
